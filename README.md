# Coding Curriculum

A beginner-friendly guide to understanding how code works in the real world, extracted from a production codebase.

## Overview

This curriculum teaches programming concepts through mental models and practical examples, not just syntax. It's designed for beginners who want to understand not just *how* to code, but *why* code works the way it does.

## What's Inside

The curriculum is organized into 6 parts with 37 concepts total:

- **Part 1: Getting Started** - Hands-on guide to development tools (Git, Python, uv, project structure)
- **Part 2: Foundational Mental Models** - How code really works (servers, deployment, state, scaling)
- **Part 3: Backend Development** - APIs, databases, caching, async processing
- **Part 4: Frontend Development** - Components, state management, API integration
- **Part 5: Cloud & Infrastructure** - Cloud storage, serverless, containerization
- **Part 6: Advanced Topics** - ML basics, AI/LLMs, testing, monitoring

## Getting Started

Start with the [Introduction](coding_course/00-introduction.md) which provides:
- Complete table of contents
- Learning path recommendations
- How to use the curriculum

**For absolute beginners**: Start with [Part 1: Getting Started](coding_course/01-getting-started.md)

**For those with some experience**: Start with [Part 2: Foundational Mental Models](coding_course/02-foundational-mental-models.md)

## Philosophy

1. **Concepts over syntax** - Understand the "why" before the "how"
2. **Real-world analogies** - Abstract ideas explained through relatable examples
3. **Progressive complexity** - Start simple, build understanding gradually
4. **Practical application** - Connect concepts to real code and systems
5. **Interconnected learning** - Show how concepts relate to each other

## Estimated Time

- **Total**: ~80 minutes of reading + hands-on exercises
- **Recommended pace**: 14 weeks (one concept every 2-3 days with practice)
- **Accelerated**: Can be completed in 2-3 weeks of focused study

## Target Audience

- **Beginners** wanting to learn programming fundamentals
- **Career switchers** looking to understand web development
- **Students** seeking to understand how real applications work
- **Experienced developers** looking to fill conceptual gaps or teach others

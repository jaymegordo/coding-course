# Coding Curriculum: Learning to Program Through Real-World Concepts

> **Reading time:** ~4 minutes  
> A beginner-friendly guide to understanding how code works in the real world, extracted from a production codebase.

## Welcome

This curriculum teaches programming concepts through mental models, not syntax. Instead of starting with "Hello World," we start with foundational concepts that experienced developers take for granted. Once you understand these, learning specific languages and frameworks becomes much easier.

## What You'll Learn

30 programming concepts organized into 5 parts:

### Part 1: Foundational Mental Models
**12 concepts** - The foundation for everything else

1. Everything is Code Running Somewhere
2. Servers are Just Computers
3. Code Lives and Runs
4. Deployment and Updates
5. Environments
6. State and Persistence
7. Networks and Communication
8. Concurrency
9. Scaling
10. Dependencies
11. Configuration vs. Code
12. The Request Journey

**[→ Start Part 1](01-foundational-mental-models.md)**

---

### Part 2: Backend Development
**7 concepts** - Servers, APIs, databases, and backend systems

13. Web Frameworks
14. APIs - The Restaurant Menu of the Web
15. Databases and ORMs
16. Authentication and Authorization
17. Async Processing and Task Queues
18. Caching
19. Real-Time Communication

**[→ Continue to Part 2](02-backend-development.md)**

---

### Part 3: Frontend Development
**4 concepts** - User interfaces and how they interact with backends

20. Component Architecture
21. State Management
22. API Integration
23. Forms and Validation

**[→ Continue to Part 3](03-frontend-development.md)**

---

### Part 4: Cloud & Infrastructure
**3 concepts** - Cloud services, deployment, and infrastructure

24. Cloud Storage
25. Serverless Functions
26. Containerization

**[→ Continue to Part 4](04-cloud-infrastructure.md)**

---

### Part 5: Advanced Topics
**4 concepts** - Machine learning, AI, testing, and monitoring

27. Machine Learning Basics
28. AI Agents and LLMs
29. Testing
30. Monitoring and Logging

**[→ Continue to Part 5](05-advanced-topics.md)**

## How to Use This Curriculum

**Read in order** - Each concept builds on previous ones. Start with Part 1.

**For beginners**: Read sequentially, take your time, think about real-world examples.

**For experienced developers**: Skim familiar concepts, focus on connections between concepts.

**Learning path**: 12 weeks (2 weeks per part, with Part 2 split across 4 weeks).

## Key Principles

1. **Everything is code running somewhere** - No magic, just code on computers
2. **Start simple, build complexity** - Simple concepts build the foundation
3. **Real-world analogies** - Abstract ideas explained through relatable examples
4. **Connections matter** - Concepts don't exist in isolation
5. **Understanding over memorization** - Focus on the "why," not just the "what"

## Prerequisites

**None.** If you can use a computer, browse the internet, and think logically, you're ready.

## What This Curriculum Covers

**Concepts and mental models** - Not specific syntax, step-by-step tutorials, or framework details.

Think of this as learning the "grammar" of programming before learning specific "languages."
